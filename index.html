                <li class="prevention-list">Clean up litter, as any exposed trash will attract rats</li>
                <li class="prevention-list">Store garbage in hard plastic rat-resistant containers with lids</li>
                <li class="prevention-list">Make sure all of the occupants in your building have enough trash containers</li>
                <li class="prevention-list">Keep landscaped areas around your property free of tall weeds. Trim shrubs that are close to the ground</li>
                <li class="prevention-list">Check for cracks or holes in the foundation of your building, as well as in the sidewalk and under doors. Repair cracks and holes by filling and sealing them</li>
                <li class="prevention-list">Help keep parks, sidewalks and green streets clean and uncluttered by disposing of trash properly and sponsoring rat-resistant cans</li>
